Description: An 'R6' class for centralizing data. The datacenter object enables
    memory-efficient joining, binding, and updating (e.g., replacing missing 
    values) of id-anchored data sets. This is especially useful when variable 
    values for the same observations are spread across several different data 
    sets.
